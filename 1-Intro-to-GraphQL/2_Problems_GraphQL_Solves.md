# Problems GraphQL Solves
GraphQL solves several problems commonly faced when building APIs, including:

* Over-fetching: Unlike REST APIs, where clients often receive excessive data, GraphQL enables clients to specify the precise data they require. This eliminates unnecessary data transmission, enhancing bandwidth utilization and improving performance.
*Under-fetching: REST APIs may necessitate multiple requests to different endpoints for gathering all required data, resulting in increased latency and complexity. GraphQL consolidates these requests into a single query, reducing round trips and streamlining data retrieval.
*Versioning efficiency: Traditional REST APIs require separate endpoints for different versions, leading to maintenance difficulties. GraphQL simplifies versioning by allowing seamless addition of new fields and types, eliminating the need for multiple endpoints.
*Enhanced flexibility: REST APIs enforce a fixed data structure, constraining clients to work with predefined formats. In contrast, GraphQL empowers clients to precisely request the data they need and receive it in a predictable format, fostering flexibility and adaptability.

By tackling these issues, GraphQL revolutionizes API development, offering a more efficient and flexible approach to data retrieval and manipulation.
