# Thinking in Graphs
"Thinking in Graphs" is a way of thinking and approaching GraphQL that revolves around how data is structured and queried. In GraphQL, data is organized in a graph-like structure, where objects are represented as nodes and relationships between them are represented as edges.

This approach offers flexibility and simplicity when retrieving data. Instead of retrieving fixed sets of data, clients can navigate through the graph by following the connections between nodes to fetch only the specific data they need. It's like exploring a web of interconnected information to get precisely what you're looking for.
