# My GraphQL Repository
This repository is dedicated to my learning journey with GraphQL. Through this project, I have learned the fundamentals of GraphQL, including queries, mutations, subscriptions, schema design, resolvers, and more.

I began my journey by reading the official documentation provided by GraphQL.org and followed a few online tutorials to get started. In this repository, you will find several projects I have built using GraphQL.

I hope that this repository can be a valuable resource for anyone looking to learn more about GraphQL or to get started with their own GraphQL projects. Please feel free to explore the projects and reach out to me with any questions or feedback.
