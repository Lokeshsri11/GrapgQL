# Fields in GraphQL
In GraphQL, fields are like the specific pieces of information you want to retrieve or modify. They represent properties of the data you're interested in.

For example, let's say you have a schema that defines a User type with fields like name, email, and age. You can use these fields to retrieve specific information about a user.

```graphql
query {
  user {
    name
    email
  }
}
```

In this query, name and email are the fields you want to retrieve from the user object. So, you're asking the server to give you the user's name and email.

When you send this query to the server, it will respond with the requested data:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "name": "Lokesh Srivastav",
      "email": "lokeshsri1109@gmail.com"
    }
  }
}
```
In this response, the server provides the name and email fields along with their corresponding values.

Fields allow you to specify exactly what data you need from the server, making your queries more efficient and avoiding over-fetching of unnecessary data.

I hope this explanation makes it easier to understand the concept of fields in GraphQL!
